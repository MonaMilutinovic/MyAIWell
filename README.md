# MyAIWell
A personalized coach for wellbeing - Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary
 We have plenty of data in smartwatches and mobilephones that can give us a more comprehensive picture of things we can change. Think if you can combine the personal data with personal goals and possible time space. Then we would be able to make choices that achieve a greater well-being, prevent injuries and welfare diseases.
## Background
We live busy lives and don't always have time or take the time to make thoughtful choices that affect our lives, bodies and well-being. Which means that we get strain injuries and welfare diseases. We often make short-term, one-sided efforts that do not lead to a healthier life.
## How is it used?
Anyone who has a mobile phone, smart watch and an interest in health and exercise and uses a digital calendar may have a desire to achieve a long-term, personalized health-promoting life.
## Data sources and AI methods
Manual Input that is needed from the user:  age, sex, weight, personal goals (fitness, weight, health, preventive needs/diseases).
Digital input from e.g. smart watches (data: heart rate, sleep and activity) connection to calendars (data: free time spaces).

Internet Data:
 -research into forms of exercise, rehabilitation of illnesses and injuries and other health-promoting measures.
- suggestions for forms of training and training programs, e.g. Youtube
- research into food substances that benefit health.
- recipes for meals adapted to the personal training goals, activity level and possible time space.

Output:
-Suggestions for activities, e.g. if sedentary if the calendar allows take a 10 minute brisk walk. If the heart rate is high - go for a slow 20 minute walk/ meditate.
- Suggestions for a weekly menu - select menues and a shopping list can be created.
- Suggestions for training forms with links to instructional videos on YouTube as well as varied suggestions for activities that together strengthen body and mind based on input.
- Suggestions for a suitable time for going to bed.
- Show Health status against the personal training goals aggregated over a short and long period.
## Challenges
People have free will and may need more motivation than advice from an app. Maybe a real person who can make sure that the efforts you need to make are done.
## What next?
Meal suggestions based on nearby restaurants as well as exercise suggestions based on the local area's range of businesses and nature.
New input such as stress level, blood sugar or oxygenation can be included. I would need help with the programming technique.
## Acknowledgments
My sources of inspiration are the health apps found in mobile phones and smart watches, especially Samsung's Health and Magic Miljas - Growth spurt recognition project.
